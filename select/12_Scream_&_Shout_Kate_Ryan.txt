I cannot see you but I know you're there
To awaken my heart tonight
There's a dream I will follow
A passion I search
Many mountains to climb
I've finally found you
My kisses surround you
There's no turnin' back this time
Can you hear me call
Can you hear me call
I'll tell it to the one I love
Shout it to the World Above
Baby don't you understand
That everything belongs to us
I wanna scream and shout
Can you hear me
I wanna make you shine
I wanna scream out loud
Please believe me
I wanna make you mine
I know what you're thinkin'
So don't say a word
We'll do everything on the fly
I'm out on a mission
Got a very strong vision
Of what's on your mind
I've finally found you
My kisses surround you
There's no turnin' back this time
Can you hear me call
Can you hear me call
I'll tell it to the one I love
Shout it to the World Above
Baby don't you understand
That everything belongs to us
I wanna scream and shout
Can you hear me
I wanna make you shine
I wanna scream out loud
Please believe me
I wanna make you mine
