Well, shake it up, baby, now
(Shake it up baby)
Twist and shout
(Twist and shout)

Come on, come on, come on, come on, baby, now
Come on and work it all out
Well, work it on out, honey
You know you look so good

You know you got me goin' now
Just like I knew you would
Well, shake it up, baby, now
Twist and shout

Come on, come on, come on, come on, baby, now
Come on and work it all out
You know you twist, little girl
You know you twist so fine

Come on and twist a little closer now
And let me know that you're mine, (woo)

(Ah-ah-ah-ah-wow)

Baby, now
Twist and shout
Come on, come on, come on, come on, baby, now
Come on and work it all out
You know you look so good
You know you twist so fine
Come on and twist a little closer now
And let me know that you're mine

Well, shake it, shake it, shake it, baby, now
Well, shake it, shake it, shake it, baby, now
Well, shake it, shake it, shake it, baby, now
(Ah-ah-ah-ah)
